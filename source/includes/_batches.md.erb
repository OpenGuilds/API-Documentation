# Batches
## The Batch Object

> The Batch object looks like this:

```json
<%= JSON.pretty_generate(batch) %>
```

Batches are created when you send [data](#the-datum-object)
to a [guild](#the-guild-object).

Batches can have many webhooks. Webhooks will send the
data from a batch to its endpoint when the batch status changes to completed.

Batches are funded by the guild before they are given to guild 
[members](#the-member-object) to work on.

Batches are accounted for by a guild's [bank](#the-bank-object)


The object has the following attributes:

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
object | string | The object's type. Objects of the same type have the same structure.
id | string | The ID of the batch being returned.
data_completed_count | integer | A count of all completed data in the batch.
data_count | integer | A count of all data in the batch.
data | object | The data objects associated with a given batch.
webhooks | array[webhooks] | An array of webhook objects.
status | string | A status describing the current state of the batch.

The status of a batch object can be one of the following:

Status | Description
------ | -----------
processing | Not all data in the batch has been completed.
completed | All data in the batch has been processed and marked as complete.
archived | The data has been archived and removed from normal listing.


## The Datum Object

> The datum object looks like this:

```json
<%= JSON.pretty_generate(datum) %>
```

The singular word for data is called a datum.

A datum is given to each task and held until workers perform the required work.

When a worker submits their work, new parameters the worker has created are
added to a datum and it is opened to the next task through a connection.


The data object has the following attributes:

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
object | string | The object's type. Objects of the same type have the same structure.
id | string | The ID of the datum being returned.
status | string | A status describing the current state of the datum.
parameters | object | A hash structure of the given parameters and those added by workers.

The status of a datum object can be one of the following:

Status | Description
------ | -----------
processing | The data has not been processed by all required tasks.
completed | The data has been processed by all required tasks.

## The Webhook Object

> The webhook object looks like this:

```json
<%= JSON.pretty_generate(webhook) %>
```

A webhook is triggered when a batch object is completed.

It will send a JSON call to its destination with a secret key you create to
verify its origin.

The data object has the following attributes:

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
destination | string | A valid http url.
secret | object | A secret you keep to verify its origin.

<aside class="notice">
Note that the secret will not be returned in any get request. It is only sent
when delivering the batch payload to its destination.
</aside>

## Create a Batch

Creating a batch is as simple as specifying the data you want to use for the
initial task as well as the destinations for the data when it is completed.

```ruby
require 'open-guilds'
OpenGuilds.api_key = '8641fb38-294a-41d9-9591-3449dfd99910'

file = File.read('path/to/data.json')

OpenGuilds::Batch.create(
  guild: 1,
  params: JSON.parse(file)
)
```

```shell
curl <%= api_endpoint + "/api/guild/<GUILD_ID>/batch" %>
  -u "8641fb38-294a-41d9-9591-3449dfd99910"
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
  -d "@data.json"
```

> If we have a guild with only one input parameter with a key value of
> "image_url".

> Then your data.json file should look like:

```json
{
  "batch": {
    "data": [
      { "image_url": "www.images.com/image1.png", },
      { "image_url": "www.images.com/image2.png", },
      { "image_url": "www.images.com/image3.png", },
    ],
    "webhooks": [
      {
        "destination": "https://your.service.com", 
        "secret": "secret123",
      },
    ]
  }
}
```
> Each key value within the "data" array should match the required input
> parameters for the Guild.

> Which should return your batch:

```json
<%= JSON.pretty_generate(batch) %>
```

## List all Batches
```ruby
