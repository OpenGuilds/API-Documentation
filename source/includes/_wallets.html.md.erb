Each [guild](#the-guild-object) you join has its own individual wallet.

Wallets store a history of [transactions](#the-transaction-object), 
which can be different types.

Wallets are backed by a [bank](#the-bank-object) which the owner is responsible
for for fulfilling.

Wallet credits can be exchanged by workers by requesting a payout.

A Wallet has the following attributes:

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
object | string | A string representing the object type.
id | string | The ID of the Wallet being returned.
transactions | array[transactions] | A time ordered history of Transactions, with the newest first.
balance | string | The total amount of Credits from adding all Credits minus Debits.
balance_cents | integer | The balance represented in cents.


## The Bank Object

A bank is has a wallet that is owned by the guild called the vault.

The bank records all transactions made in and out of associated wallets.

Users can place requests for a payout of their credits, which are accepted
by the guild owner.
