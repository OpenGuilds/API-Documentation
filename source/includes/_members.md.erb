# Members

## The Member Object
> The Member object looks like this:

```json
{
  "object": "Member",
  "id": "1",
  "email": "email@example.com",
  "quality_score": 0.86,
  "credit": "$5.00",
  "credit_cents": 500,
  "created": "2015-05-22T14:56:29.000Z",
  "updated": "2015-05-22T14:56:28.000Z"
}
```

Members are individuals in a [guilds](#the-guild-object) community.
Members can get qualifications, subscribe to [tasks](#the-task-object) 
and perform work for a guild.

Members are rewarded for their correct work with guild credits.
Members can request a payout from a guild which is then authorized by the guild owner.

Members are assigned a quality score which is measured by their answers given to
specific questions according to a golden set of answers.

The object has the following attributes:

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
object | string | The object being described by the incoming data, in this case a Guild.
id | string | The ID of the batch being returned.
email | string | The email of the Member.
quality_score | float | A score between 0.00 and 1.00 which determines the members test accuracy.
credit | string | The total available credit a user has to request a payout.
credit_cents | integer | The total available credit a user has to request a payout expressed in the number of cents.
